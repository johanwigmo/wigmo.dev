**TL;DR** – I'm an app developer, a father, and a husband.

I share my work on [GitHub](http://github.com/johanwigmo), and you can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://se.linkedin.com/in/johanwigmo).

For over a decade, I’ve worked as an app developer. My focus has primarily been on iOS, but in recent years, I’ve expanded my skills to include Android development. This shift has broadened my understanding of app ecosystems, though I sometimes feel I’ve missed out on the latest trends in iOS.

Over the years I've got confidence to take on most iOS projects and I've always been eager to learn when I need to. Starting to know my way around Android probably isn't hurting. I've had roles where I kept working more in the background with bugs and maintenance, to having lead responsibility and mentored junior developers. With the years working on different projects, I've learned the importance of quality and take responsibility for your work, to build like you have to maintain the projects for many years. 

I'm currently trying to up my iOS game further by working on hobby projects, which I showcase under [Projects](/projects). I'm also learning all the new features I've been missing out on and relearning the basics once again - documenting it on [stories.wigmo.dev](https://stories.wigmo.dev) - while also logging my journey on [journal.wigmo.dev](https://journal.wigmo.dev).

## Who I Am

I’m a husband and father of two, living in a cozy house in Sweden. I work full-time at one of Scandinavia’s leading digital agencies while exploring side projects whenever I can. Balancing family, work, and personal growth keeps me busy, but it’s a challenge I enjoy.

I value health — both physical and mental. I focus on eating well, daily stretching, walking, and regular workouts. Breathing exercises, reflection, and continuous learning keep me grounded, though I’ll admit that sleep and proper winding down are areas I’m working on improving.

For fun, I love listening to music, taking time to zone out and recharge, or heading outdoors for a round of disc golf or a bike ride.
