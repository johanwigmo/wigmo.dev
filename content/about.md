**TL;DR** – I'm an app developer, a father, and a husband.

I share my work on [GitHub](http://github.com/johanwigmo), and you can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://se.linkedin.com/in/johanwigmo).

## About Me

For over a decade, I’ve worked as an app developer. My focus has primarily been on iOS, but in recent years, I’ve expanded my skills to include Android development. This shift has broadened my understanding of app ecosystems, though I sometimes feel I’ve missed out on the latest trends in iOS.

This website is my digital notepad—a _public_ space where I document ideas, share knowledge, and reflect on projects. From foundational programming concepts to snippets, features, and personal reflections, I’m slowly building a knowledge bank for myself and others.

I believe teaching is one of the best ways to learn. Sharing knowledge not only helps others but challenges me to deeply understand the topics I discuss.

## Who I Am

I’m a husband and father of two, living in a cozy house in Sweden. I work full-time at one of Scandinavia’s leading digital agencies while exploring side projects whenever I can. Balancing family, work, and personal growth keeps me busy, but it’s a challenge I enjoy.

I value health — both physical and mental. I focus on eating well, daily stretching, walking, and regular workouts. Breathing exercises, reflection, and continuous learning keep me grounded, though I’ll admit that sleep and proper winding down are areas I’m working on improving.

For fun, I love listening to music, taking time to zone out and recharge, or heading outdoors for a round of disc golf or a bike ride.
